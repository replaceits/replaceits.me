# replaceits.me
replaceits.me is a personal website for Sidney Williams (me!). You can find my contact information, public accounts, and my resume here. It also acts as a portfolio and showcases my projects.

## Server
The site is currently being run off of a Digital Ocean, Fedora 25, droplet. My domain name and SSL cert were obtained through Namecheap. I currently update the site through the use of `git`. In order to do this I have a bare repository folder that gets pushed to from my local machine and the `post-receive` hook on the remote server runs `make` and `rsync`s the build into the server directory.

## Prerequisites
[`yuicompressor`](https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor)  

[`SCSS`](https://github.com/sass/sass)

## Building
Simply run `make` in the root of this project and it will auto-compile/build/compress/copy the needed files into `./build/replaceits.me/`

## Installation
Make sure you have a LAMP stack and `mv` the contents of the `./build/replaceits.me/` directory to the server root. (For EX. `/var/www/html/` or `/srv/http`)

## Contributing
If you find a bug/error anywhere in the site please feel free to submit an issue. If you have a fix then please submit a pull request as well and I will verify and merge if applicable.
